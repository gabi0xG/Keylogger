# Keylogger
Implementation of an educational keyboard event logger in C++, running within the application’s own focus. 
Designed as an academic practice to study keyboard input handling, event-driven interaction, and structured logging to files, with explicit user consent, data minimization, and clear ethical boundaries—no global hooks, no hidden capture, strictly focused on learning secure and responsible input management.
